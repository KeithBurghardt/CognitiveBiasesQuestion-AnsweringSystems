In this folder are 3 subfolders:

(1) Task_Dynamic_Scores_2

(2) Task_Dynamic_Scores_8

(3) Task_Non-Dynamic_Scores

The first two allow for answer scores to be dynamically updated. 
Scores in other words reflect the number of people who considered 
that answer to be the best before the experiment started. Either 
2 or 8 answers are visible to users, for each respective folder.
Before starting an experiment, set up the MySQL server as below 
and run "configure_mysql_start.php".

Task_Non-Dynamic_Scores randomizes answer position. There are 3 
options possible for this code:

    (1) Random: 		list answers randomly (no scores visible)
				This is meant to study how users pick answers 
				independent of perceived answer popularity.

    (2) Social Influence: 	list answers randomly (scores listed highest 
				to lowest). This is meant to simulate Stack 
				Exchange (and other Q&A boards) where answers 
				are by default ordered from most to least popular.

    (3) Social Influence Random:list answers and scores randomly. This allows us 
				to allow for us to study how answer the two 
				relate to each other.

Each of these options can be selected in user_start.php, by changing $type:
    (1) $type = "random";
    (2) $type = "popularity_high_low";
    (3) $type = "popularity_randomized";
All questions and answers we used can be seen in acknowledgements.php.

NOTE:

- This code requires a connection to a MySQL server. The server, user name, 
  password, and database can be set in "db_utility.php".
- The code reads from several tables to set up questions and answers:

	1) "Questions" table - has question titles listed in "Title1"..."Title10" 
		             - has body of questions listed in "Body1"..."Body10"
			     - these are all strings

	2) "Answers1" table ..."Answers10" table - lists answers for question 1, 
						   question 2, ...
	   					 - these are all strings.

- This data requires access to several table columns in a table labeled 
  "experiments_new":

+----------------+------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

	hit_id, worker_id, & experiment_id are defunct. 
	All columns are self-explanitory, except:
	- visibility: whether scores are visible/ordered randomly. 
		      This is the $type value above.
	- status: submitted (else data is not recorded)
	- TimeInArray_i: the time (Unix Time) when a mouse began 
			 scrolling over answer "i".
	- TimeOutArray_i: the time (Unix Time) when a mouse left
                          answer "i".

- Furthermore, the code requres the table "survey_codes"
  with the following columns:

+-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field       | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| survey_code | int(11) | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| id          | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
+-------------+---------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
